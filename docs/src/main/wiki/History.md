Each execution entry consists of following details:
* **file name** that was executed,
* **user and date of upload** the script,
* **user and date of execution**,
* **instance** where the script has been executed including domain name.

There are two operations available on the history screen
* **execution summary** preview,
* **script preview**.

The latter takes the changes that are applied over-the time, i.e. it displays the actual script that has been executed.

Using the button marked as (1) a quick switch to import panel is available.

The filtering box (2) makes it possible to filter the history for given type only. Available types are:
* Automatic run
* Run on author
* Run on publish
