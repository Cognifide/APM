## Tool history (short)
The tool originated in 2013 after facing the very same permission management issue. Once gathered all the actual challenges and ways used to resolve them it started to be clear that the Domain Specific Language (DSL) approach would suit best here.

In 2016 the decision to open-source the tool was made and eventually in September, 2016 it was made public.

### Name clarification
One may find confused seeing the name AEM Permission Management (APM). Originally the tool was called CQ Security Management (CQSM) and number of references can be found in code still. As in the time of opensourcing the AEM name superseded CQ the decision to rebrand the was made.
